# Rest API CRUD - Laravel Project

This project is a **REST API CRUD** application built with Laravel. It demonstrates the creation of a simple RESTful API that supports operations such as **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** (CRUD) on a `student` resource.

The application provides the basic functionality to manage student records, including storing and retrieving information like names, email addresses, phone numbers, and languages.

## Features

- Simple, fast routing for API endpoints.
- Powerful database ORM (Eloquent) for managing `student` records.
- RESTful architecture for efficient and scalable API development.
- Integrated with Laravelâ€™s powerful features like migrations, validation, and more.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /api/students** - Retrieve all students.
- **GET /api/students/{id}** - Retrieve a single student by ID.
- **POST /api/students** - Create a new student record.
- **PUT /api/students/{id}** - Update an existing student record.
- **DELETE /api/students/{id}** - Delete a student record.

## Database Schema

The `students` table includes the following fields:
- `id`: Primary key (auto-increment).
- `name`: String, required.
- `email`: String, required.
- `phone`: String, optional.
- `language`: String, required.
- `timestamps`: Created and updated timestamps.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CRISHFAS/Restapi-Crud-Laravel.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash

cd Restapi-Crud-Laravel

3. Install dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash

composer install

4. Create a .env file by copying the .env.example and configuring your database:

   ```bash

cp .env.example .env

5. Run the migrations to create the students table:

   ```bash

php artisan migrate

6. Start the Laravel development server:

   ```bash

    php artisan serve

# Testing

To test the API, you can use tools like Postman or cURL. Ensure that your local server is running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or your configured URL.
